		<title>Top 10 Hockey Forwards</title>
	<head>

		<body>
			<li>1. Connor McDavid. 
He is the most skilled offensively, and is always tenacious in all 200ft of the ice. Connor McDavid is the golden standard for the NHL and is the consensus #1. </li>
<p> </p>
			<li>2. Leon Draisaitl. 
Despite the aura of people thinking he was nothing without McDavid, Leon has become the centre for his own line without Connor and only really plays alongside him on the powerplay. Leon is also by far the best player in the world come playoffs. </li>
<p> </p>
			<li>3. Nathan MacKinnon. 
It is rare that a player has the mix of size, speed, and skill that MacKinnon does. He also shows heart and determination to win, as shown by the Colorado Stanley Cup. He is a gritty power forward who drives the play and is no slouch defensively either. </li>
<p> </p>
			<li>4. Matthew Tkachuk.
As an Oiler fan, this hurts me to say, but in his young career, Matthew Tkachuk displayed how valuable he was to the Calgary Flames by leaving them. His 2022-23 campaign with the Florida Panthers landed him here at #4. He has become a major piece of the heart and soul of that team, and he gets into scrums and defends himself and his fellow stars. He is the definition of the player you want to play with and hate to play against.
<p> </p>
			<li>5. Jason Robertson.
Look out hockey world! Jason Robertson has just begun his bright career and has already shown that he is an elite level goal-scorer. With slick hands and a deadly release, I expect him to maintain his high position on this list as he has not yet peaked in his career.
<p> </p>
			<li>6. Mikko Rantanen.
With a strong tenacity and an elite level wrister and nifty passing, Mikko Rantanen is quietly skilled and sometimes overshadowed by his teammate Nathan MacKinnon. Although I have MacKinnon higher on this list as a standout superstar, MacKinnon has publicly said that Rantanen is the most skilled player on the team, which in certain areas of the game I would actually agree.
<p> </p>
			<li>7. Auston Matthews.
With one of the deadliest wrist shots in the league and an awareness for both directions of play, some argue Auston Matthews should be higher ion this list, though I think his style of play is fairly one-dimensional and he had a relativly rough season in 2022-23 so I just can't bring myself to put him higher even though he has shown top-5 glimpses.
			<li>8. David Pastrnak.
Like Matthews, many people believe Pastrnak to be a top-5-er, and in terms of skill they are correct
